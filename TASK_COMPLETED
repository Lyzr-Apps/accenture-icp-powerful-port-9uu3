TASK_COMPLETED
Date: 2026-02-26
Project: Accenture ABM Intelligence Platform

Updates Applied:
1. Manager Agent (Playbook Orchestrator) - Updated to process ALL 28+ reports, not just 3-4. Explicit mandatory report list included.
2. Report Summarizer Agent - Updated with expanded topic taxonomy and mandatory search queries across all categories.
3. Contributor Extraction Agent - Updated for exhaustive extraction of ALL people (authors, co-authors, editors, researchers, advisors, reviewers, designers, acknowledged individuals) — not just lead authors.
4. UI handleGenerate prompt - Expanded with all 28 reports listed, new topic tags, and explicit instructions for comprehensive contributor extraction.
5. Industry dropdown - Added Healthcare, Life Sciences, Cybersecurity, Workforce & Talent, Sustainability & Energy, Supply Chain, Consumer.
6. Topic tag colors - Added Healthcare, Cybersecurity, Sustainability, Workforce, Agentic AI, Sovereign AI, Supply Chain, Payments, Consumer, Inclusion/Diversity, Autonomous/Quantum/Edge/Spatial.
7. Sample data - Expanded from 4 to 12 reports covering all categories with representative contributors.
8. Sample enriched contacts - Added 7 new contacts across Healthcare, Cybersecurity, Sustainability, Workforce, Insurance, Banking, Strategy.

Bug Fix - Zero Output Issue (2026-02-26):
9. parseAgentResponse - Completely rewritten with 8 search strategies including deep recursive search through nested response objects, handling double-wrapped responses, text-as-JSON parsing, and module_outputs fallback.
10. Server-side route (api/agent/route.ts) - Fixed envelope extraction to handle string vs object task.response correctly, prevent double-encoding via JSON.stringify on already-stringified responses, and extract module_outputs from multiple locations.
11. Poll timeout - Increased from 5 minutes to 10 minutes to accommodate manager agents coordinating 8 sub-agents across 28+ reports.
12. Error diagnostics - Added comprehensive console logging on both server and client side to trace response shapes through the parsing pipeline. Error messages now show response keys, status, and previews when parsing fails.
13. handleGenerate - Added early error detection for agent failures before attempting parse, and detailed diagnostic error messages showing response structure when parsing fails.
